# SVG Logo Maker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
 
  ## Description
  In this project we built a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and then saves the generated SVG to an .svg file.

  In this assignment we continued to familiarize ourselves with class constructors, modularization and test-driven development.
